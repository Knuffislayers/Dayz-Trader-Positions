Here you have two Trader positions for the Sakhal map. 
For the moment, there ar only the Trader-NPC's. No Deco for now. Maybe later.

Installation:
Download the zip.
In the .zip are two Folders.
In the folder Trader, copy the file "TraderObjects.txt" and paste it \Config\Tader\ on you're Server
and overwrite the existing file.

In the folder "vppmap" are two files.

Restart you're Server and done.

Feel free to help and edit the files on Github
