Here you have two Trader positions for the Sakhal map. 
For the moment, there are only the Trader-NPC's. No Deco for now. Maybe later.
*backup the original "TraderObjects.txt" file on your Server-
*Put this file "TraderObjects.txt" in the Folder \Config\Tader\ on you're Server and overwrite the existing file.
Restart you're Server and done.
