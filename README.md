Here you have two Trader positions for the Sakhal map. 
For the moment, there ar only the Trader-NPC's. No Deco for now. Maybe later.

Download the zip.
In the .zip are two Folders.

Now "Banking" is necessary.

In the folder "vppmap" are two files.
The TraderObjects.json file contains the Tradermarkers of the Sakhal map.
Just overwrite the existing file on the "config" folder.

The TraderObjects.txt file only contains the postitiondata including code, to implement the positions by you're self.
Just choose one of the Files.

In "Traderdeco" you'll find opject Spawn data for some Firebarells on the Tradersides.
A short readme is in Traderdeco to.

Restart you're Server and done.

Feel free to help and edit the files on Github
